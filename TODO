TODO List for XML::XPath

- Functions (see Function.pm) - almost all done as of 0.50
- Operators (see Expr.pm) - all complete
- to_boolean (in all classes) - done
- Precedence (Parser.pm) - done (re-written)
- Optimisations
	This is a tough one. There are lots of little
	optimisations that can occur. For example, the
	predicate '[' Number ']' can be directly optimised
	to an array access. Same goes for predicates
	containing any of the functions last(), first(),
	etc.
- SAX Handler/Driver - mostly done. Waiting for SAX2/Namespaces
