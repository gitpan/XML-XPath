TODO List for XML::XPath

- Functions (see Function.pm)
- Operators (see Expr.pm)
- to_boolean (in all classes)
- Precedence (Parser.pm)
- Optimisations
	This is a tough one. There are lots of little
	optimisations that can occur. For example, the
	predicate '[' Number ']' can be directly optimised
	to an array access. Same goes for predicates
	containing any of the functions last(), first(),
	etc.
- SAX Handler/Driver
